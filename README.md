# react-native-chess
This is a simple chess client I built as a school project. It uses awesome [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) platform as backend and puzzle sources.

The app is functional but codebase is unfortunately not clean. I want to improve the code quality and refactor duplicate code when I have some free time.

### Requirements
Checkout react-native <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> page to install dependencies based on your OS and target platform.

### Installation

Clone this repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/halilb/react-native-chess
$ cd react-native-chess
$ npm install or yarn
```

### How to start
```sh
$ react-native run-android
$ react-native run-ios
```

### Running on Expo
I created a branch to make the app work on [Expo](https://expo.io). Checkout [expo branch](https://github.com/halilb/react-native-chess/tree/expo).
